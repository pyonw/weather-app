# Randomized Item Microservice

This repository contains files for testing the microservice that generates a single random item from a list.

## Instructions:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install dependencies (Node.js and Express for the backend, and any other related packages).
3. Access the randomized item locally:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/api/getRandomItem to start generating a randomized item.
   - You can also make an HTTP request to the `/api/getRandomItem` endpoint of this microservice. The microservice should log the received data to the console. Access specific properties of the returned data (e.g., id, name) for use in your code.
4. The repository includes a test file with a function to test if the HTTP request returns the correct data.
5. Make adjustments if needed.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.
